This is derivative work from https://github.com/Mearitek/MeariSdk whose license is unclear, since the original repository has been made public I'm using it on bona-fide basis
Once that's settled I'd like to make it available under GPL v3 https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html or CC BY 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ (or any equivalent) meanwhile the status is uncertain because the original authors did not provide any licensing info
